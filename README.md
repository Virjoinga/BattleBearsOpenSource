# BattleBearsOpenSource
A project to reverse-engineer Battle Bears games and make them open source.

This project is still WIP as BB-1 is still being worked on before others. I am aware that SkyVu is making BBZero open source but SkyVu being SkyVu, they'll probably do that game only and stop.

The games this project will be focusing on are: BB-1, BBZombies, BBBlast, BBFortress, and BBGO (if possible).
